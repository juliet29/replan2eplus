! Minimal.idf
! Basic file description: This is a minimal configuration necessary to run.
! Highlights: Illustrates minimal items necessary to perform run.
! BUILDING, SURFACEGEOMETRY, LOCATION and DESIGNDAY (or RUNPERIOD) are the absolute minimal required input objects.
! TIME STEP IN HOUR is included so as to not get warning error.
! Including two design days, Run Control object and RunPeriod to facilitate use.
! Although not incredibly useful, this could be used as a weather/solar calculator.
! Building: None.
!
! Internal gains description: None.
